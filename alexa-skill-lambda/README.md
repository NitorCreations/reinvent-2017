# Lambda for Alexa skill

Written for Node.js, this code is to be used as Alexa skill for reporting alerts.
It uses a small set of pre-defined interactions (intents) to ask user what they want to report, and afterwards resolves user's location.

## Setup

This guide describes how to install and develop the skill, production use and distribution of the skill is not covered in this document.

### Prerequisites

Your Alexa device and your AWS account need to be registered to the same account (email address). Otherwise you won't be able to use custom skills, i.e. skills that are not published in Alexa Skill Marketplace.

This skill requires premission to use device address (configured in [skill configuration](https://alexa.amazon.com/spa/index.html#skills/your-skills/?ref-suffix=ysa_gw)). The address needs to be defined in [Alexa settings](https://alexa.amazon.com/spa/index.html#settings) (Device configuration).
